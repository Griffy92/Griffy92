### Hello, I'm Dom!

My background has mainly been in the Advertising Technology landscape where I've worked for a Supply-Side Platform technology for almost 10 years. My role is fairly diverse but key skillsets are below:

- Stakeholder management across senior and junior roles.
- Managing large scale projects from inception to delivery.
- Troubleshoot platform :bug:.
- Conveying client wants/needs in the form of user journeys/stories.
- Anaylysing business processes & needs.
- Run platform demos.
- Scripting for automation of tasks and manipulation of data.

Working in Tech, I like to understand how things work so I took a coding course with GA and graudated from their Software Engineering Immersive program.

- ðŸ’¬ My most used languages are Python, Javascript ( React ) and Ruby ( Rails ).
